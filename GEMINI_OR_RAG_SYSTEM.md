# PDF Chat LLM Considerations

## 1. Gemini 1.5 Flash vs. RAG

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is likely better for a PDF chat application:
- More scalable
- Efficiently handles multiple PDFs
- Allows easier knowledge base updates

**Recommendation**: Consider a hybrid approach combining RAG for initial retrieval and Gemini for complex queries.

## 2. Handling Responses >8196 Tokens

Strategies:
- Chunk and stream responses
- Provide summarized answers with expansion options
- Use topic segmentation with section navigation
- Implement interactive querying for follow-ups

## 3. Evaluating LLM Performance

Methods:
- Apply NLP metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) for accuracy
- Conduct human evaluation studies
- Create task-specific benchmarks
- Perform consistency checks across query phrasings
- Measure response time and relevance
- Assess for biases
- Implement continuous monitoring

These strategies ensure comprehensive evaluation of the LLM's performance in the PDF chat application context.
